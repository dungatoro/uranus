# Urynus
Urynus is a literate programming tool; it allows code to be compiled or ran from
a markdown document. It is heavily inspired by Emacs's 
[org mode](https://orgmode.org/).

## Features
- Building source files from literate document
- Running snippets in isolation
- Rearranging code blocks
- Compilation to multiple files


## Extensibility
Urynus is written entirely in lua, a simple and extensible language often 
embedded into other applications. This should hopefully make it easier for 
creating Urynus plugins for other applications.
